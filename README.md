###

Better Barrels is a Fabric, 1.16 mod, which helps with early game inventory management.
The mod adds a new barrel which allows you to pick it up like a shulker box. To make it seem like an early game item, I have reduced the slots down to 11. This means that it cannot carry as much as the shulker box, meaning that in the future of your world, you would want to upgrade.

### Downloads

You can find downloads for the mod on the [official CurseForge page](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/better-barrels).

Any other place that the mod has been released breaks the licence and should be reported.

### Issues

You can either report issues in the [official Discord](https://discord.gg/mNWSEB5) or on the [issues page](https://github.com/Mr-Pineapple/BetterBarrels/issues) on GitHub.

### Updates

As this mod only adds one item, I can't feel that it will be updated regularly. Though if people have any ideas on what could be added then I would love to hear as I would like my mods to have as much input from the community!

### Loader

This is a Fabric mod for 1.16. The reason I chose to use fabric for this mod was because it makes it easier to update quickly when a new version releases.

If enough people ask, I will port to the Forge mod loader.
